I am a second-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/). I see myself as a computational linguist with research interests in argument mining with real-world text, and in natural language processing in general. I am also a member of the [NLIP Research Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/) at the University of Cambridge.

I obtained my MSc in [Speech and Language Processing](https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls/linguistics-and-english-language/prospective/postgraduate/msc/speech-language-processing) at the University of Edinburgh. Before that, I was an undergraduate in [Foreign Languages and Literatures](http://www.dfll.tsinghua.edu.cn/dfllen/) at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

My research focuses on automatically understanding arguments people post on the Internet. I do believe a better understanding for each other can reduce discrimination, prejudice, and stereotyping.
