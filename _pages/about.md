I am a second-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/). I see myself as a computational linguist with research interests in argument mining with real-world text, and in natural language processing in general. I am also a member of the [NLIP Research Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/) at the University of Cambridge.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
