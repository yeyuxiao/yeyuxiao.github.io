I am a second-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/). I see myself as a computational linguist with research interests in argument mining with real-world text, and in natural language processing in general. I am also a member of the [NLIP Research Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/) at the University of Cambridge.
