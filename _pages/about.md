I am currently a postdoc (Shuimu Scholar 水木学者) in the [THUNLP Group](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn) at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. My ongoing research projects include LLM-based multi-agent systems and Legal AI. I see myself as a computational linguist with a research interest in enabling AI to think and argue like humans do.

I finished my PhD in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/), sponsored by [Toshiba Research Europe Limited](https://www.toshiba.eu/pages/eu/Cambridge-Research-Laboratory/). I was also a member of the [NLIP Research Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/) at the University of Cambridge. My PhD thesis is on [argument mining with informal text](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/793d7d68-cac5-48a9-8551-97b3eeccd597). I hope that my work, by providing automatic analyses of arguments in online discussions, will foster better understanding among people with different opinions, and can ultimately reduce discrimination, prejudice, and stereotyping.  

I obtained my MSc in [Speech and Language Processing](https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls/linguistics-and-english-language/prospective/postgraduate/msc/speech-language-processing) at the University of Edinburgh. Before that, I was an undergraduate in [Foreign Languages and Literatures](http://www.dfll.tsinghua.edu.cn/dfllen/) at Tsinghua University.

Enabling AI to think and argue like humans does not diminish the need for human thought. On the contrary, it challenges us to elevate our critical and analytical thinking. I do belive the collaboration between human intellect and artificial intelligence has the potential to drive innovation and understanding to unprecedented levels.
